# Deployment Checklist - MyCareBay

Essential steps for deploying MyCareBay to production safely and reliably.

## Pre-Deployment Preparation

### Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] ESLint checks pass without errors
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed to `main`

### Build Verification
```bash
# Test local build
npm run build
npm run preview
```
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Preview works correctly
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] APIs proxy correctly

### Dependencies
```bash
npm audit
npm list --depth=0
```
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] All dependencies up to date
- [ ] No missing dependencies

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
Set in Vercel dashboard:
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` (production Supabase project)
- [ ] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (production key)
- [ ] `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google AI key for client-side)
- [ ] `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google AI key for server-side)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`

### Security Verification
- [ ] No sensitive data in repository
- [ ] Production keys different from development
- [ ] API keys have minimal required permissions

## Database Setup

### Supabase Production
- [ ] Run `supabase-migration.sql` in production SQL editor
- [ ] Verify all tables created correctly
- [ ] Check indexes and foreign key relationships
- [ ] Test Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Connection Testing
```bash
npm run test:supabase
```
- [ ] Connection successful
- [ ] Read/write operations work
- [ ] Authentication integration functional

## Vercel Deployment

### Project Setup
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```
- [ ] Project linked to correct Git repository
- [ ] Build settings configured (Node.js 18+)
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Auto-deployment enabled for `main` branch

### Serverless Functions
Test each API endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/test
```
- [ ] `/api/health` returns `{"status": "OK"}`
- [ ] `/api/test` returns test message
- [ ] `/api/auth/login` processes requests
- [ ] `/api/seniors/*` endpoints function correctly
- [ ] `/api/error-log` accepts error logging requests
- [ ] `/api/performance-log` accepts performance metrics

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Landing page loads correctly
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Senior profile CRUD operations function
- [ ] AI care advisor generates responses
- [ ] Facility checklist creation works
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

### Performance Check
- [ ] Page load times acceptable (< 3s)
- [ ] API response times reasonable (< 1s for CRUD)
- [ ] Code splitting working (check Network tab for chunks)
- [ ] Lazy loading functioning (components load on demand)
- [ ] Error boundaries working (test with intentional errors)
- [ ] AI features complete within timeout (< 10s)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals meet thresholds

### Cross-Browser Verification
- [ ] Chrome - full functionality
- [ ] Firefox - feature parity
- [ ] Safari - webkit compatibility
- [ ] Mobile browsers - core features work

## Domain & SSL (if applicable)

### Custom Domain
- [ ] Domain DNS configured
- [ ] CNAME pointing to Vercel
- [ ] SSL certificate provisioned
- [ ] HTTPS redirect enabled

### Verification
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
curl -I http://your-domain.com  # Should redirect to HTTPS
```

## Monitoring Setup

### Error Tracking
- [ ] Vercel Analytics enabled
- [ ] Console error monitoring active
- [ ] API error responses logged
- [ ] Performance regression detection

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] Uptime monitoring configured
- [ ] Alert thresholds set
- [ ] Response time tracking active

## Security Hardening

### API Security
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] SQL injection protection active
- [ ] XSS protection via React
- [ ] Rate limiting (if implemented)

### Authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens properly configured
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] User data access restricted
- [ ] API endpoints verify ownership

## Rollback Preparation

### Backup Plan
- [ ] Database backup taken
- [ ] Previous deployment ID noted
- [ ] Rollback scripts tested
- [ ] Team trained on rollback procedures

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Quick rollback via Vercel
vercel ls your-project
vercel promote PREVIOUS_DEPLOYMENT_URL --prod
```

## Launch Communication

### Team Notification
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of deployment
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] User-facing changes documented

### Post-Launch Monitoring
**First 24 Hours:**
- [ ] Monitor error rates closely
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking

**First Week:**
- [ ] Analyze performance trends
- [ ] Monitor user adoption
- [ ] Review support requests
- [ ] Optimize based on usage patterns
